## Comment on version 1.2.0

This version has a hack to combat a bug in the `airbnb`-rules. [See this](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2501).

The hack is found in the `package.json` and ensure that we're using older versions of `eslint-config-airbnb` and `eslint-config-airbnb-–base`.

Once the fix is published we'll update too.
